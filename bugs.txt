- refactor network calls from updating the exercise/ unit list when removing/updating or posting a new exercise/unit

- right exercises/units are not selected, maybe pass them in the service as event


- refactoring: introduce RawExercise, RawUnit for post/put requests, to get better code in both exercise and unit form
