Features:

- pagination for sets/exercises/units, lazy loading for sets

- add more details (weight/sets) to exercise-detail/ exercisedocument


Refactoring:

- refactor network calls from updating the exercise/ unit list when removing/updating or posting a new exercise/unit

- refactoring: introduce RawExercise, RawUnit for post/put requests, to get better code in both exercise and unit form

Bugs:
